# smf_contribution_engine

Engine for structured code transformations in Dart/Flutter.

This package powers SMF code modifications such as:
- Insert/replace widgets
- Modify widget arguments
- Insert into lists/methods/classes
- Insert imports

Most users will interact with this indirectly through the SMF Flutter CLI.

## Use with SMF CLI
This package is not intended to be installed directly. Use the SMF CLI to scaffold and configure features; this library is used under the hood.
